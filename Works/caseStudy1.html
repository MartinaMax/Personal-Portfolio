                <p class="margin-b-20">The goal of this project was to create a musician‘s portfolio for Connor Fernandez to portray his artistic side and lay the foundation for his online branding. The most important things for the client was to show who he is, what he does and advertise his work.</p>
                <p class="margin-b-20">In this project the team went trought the whole development process. Starting with qualitative research. Prototyping. And finishing with the Portfolio website.</p>
                <p class="margin-b-20">The client had few wishes for the product this is how we solved them.</p>
                <ol class="whishes-list">
                  <li ><p class="p-small">Tell his story - The solution was a infographic following the important milestones in his life as a person and musician.</p></li>
                  <li><p p class="p-small">Inlude people he collaborated with - The team decided to make a gallery with a hover effect over photo of an artist with a link to their Instagram.</p></li>
                  <li><p p class="p-small">Include all his lyrics - This was solved by putting a link to album book in pdf format for each album.</p></li>
